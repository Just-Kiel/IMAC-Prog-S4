# Boids OpenGL Simulation

## Introduction
This project is based on p6 library and the template made by Jules Fouchy. Our project is a collaboration between Aurore Lafaurie and Olivia Cr√©pin.
It had to be done in C++ and OpenGL as it is a school project for the fourth semester of the IMAC engineering school.
